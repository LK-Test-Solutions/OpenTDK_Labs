# Graphical user interface

The <code>gui.application</code> module was developed to easily create JavaFX GUI applications without dealing with the 
common JavaFX barriers.

The main class <code>BaseApplication</code> is a derivation of the <code>javafx.Application</code> class. The main class
of the own project inherits from the <code>BaseApplication</code> class instead of directly inheriting from 
<code>Application</code>. This allows to get started with the application programming easier. 

A detailed tutorial with a complete project setup can be found in the
