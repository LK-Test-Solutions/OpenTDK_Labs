# Introduction
In our fictional scenario we assume that contacts data like *first name*, *last name*, *birthdate* etc. can be retrieved by a web service request in XML format and the data sets need to be migrated into a table of a database. 
The challange for the developer is to:
* read and parse the contacts data from XML files, 
* transform the data into tabular data sets
* and write the transformed data into CSV-files, which can be imported by the DB system

# Conditions
## Input format with contacts data (XML files)
